# Angularjs app with automated tests for angular-pouchdb's put method

## How to run
 1. Prerequisites are a recent enough Node.js version (I tested with `v5.7.1`), [Bower](http://bower.io/), and Chrome (for the respective karma-launcher).
 1. Do `bower install` to get angular, pouchdb, etc.
 1. Open `index.html` in a browser other than Firefox (due to [https://pouchdb.com/errors.html#unknown_error_ff](https://pouchdb.com/errors.html#unknown_error_ff))
 1. To run the tests, do `npm install` and then `npm test`.
